## Terrain Recognition

The terrain recognition problem involves teaching robots and drones to identify and adapt to different types of landscapes or environments they may encounter during operation. 

This includes recognizing surfaces such as grass, gravel, sand, concrete, and various obstacles like rocks or stairs. 

By accurately detecting and categorizing terrain features, autonomous systems can make informed decisions about how to navigate safely and efficiently. 

Solving this challenge is crucial for improving the performance and versatility of robotic and drone applications across industries such as agriculture, search and rescue, surveillance, and infrastructure maintenance.
